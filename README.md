# funROI

This project aims to provide tools for the processing of fMRI data using functional ROI-based approaches.

## Development Status

This project is currently under active development. The toolbox is inspired by the `spm_ss` toolbox developed for MATLAB. We aim to bring similar functionality to the Python ecosystem, making it more accessible and adaptable to various workflows. Currently, work is focused on bringing core functionalities from `spm_ss` to Python.
